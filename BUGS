glupload doesn't behave correctly when forcing a transition
PLAYING->READY->PLAYING. Display should be finalized on READY but it isn't (too
high ref count?) 

To reproduce it try "tests/examples/gtk/fxtest/fxtest videotestsrc" and press
READY and then PLAY. Look at messages in stdout, a new context is created while
the other one is still alive. 

Probably the issue is not limited to upload, check all resource allocation.
